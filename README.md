# Dash MCL Licenses Repository

Welcome to the repository for the Dash Minecraft Content Licenses (Dash MCL). This repository hosts several variants of the Dash MCL, which are used exclusively for my Minecraft datapacks, mods, and resource packs.

## License Variants

- **Dash MCL ND 1.0:**  
  A strict "No Derivatives" license that prohibits any modifications or public distribution of the original Material without explicit approval. It is intended to maintain full control over my creative work.

- **Dash MCL Open 1.1:**  
  A more open variant that permits the creation and distribution of Modified Works. Modified Works may be licensed under terms chosen by the Licensee, provided they do not contain substantial verbatim copies of the original Material and include proper attribution via the Official Download Link.

- **Dash MCL Public 1.0:**  
  The most permissive variant, granting broad rights for reproduction, modification, and distribution (including commercial use) provided that proper attribution is given to the original creator.

## Purpose

These licenses are tailored for my Minecraft works. They address various use cases—such as server distribution, modpack inclusion, and ephemeral file transfer during gameplay—while ensuring that the original Material remains under my control.

## How to Use

- **Review the License Texts:**  
  Each license file in this repository contains the full legal text for that variant. Please review them to understand the applicable terms.

- **Select the Appropriate License:**  
  Choose the license variant that best meets the restrictions or freedoms required for a given project.

- **Attribution:**  
  All variants require proper attribution. The recommended attribution format is provided within each license text.
