Dash MCL ND 1.0 (Dash Minecraft Content License – No Derivatives Variant)
-------------------------------------------
This License Agreement ("Agreement") is a legal contract between Gamedash43 ("The Creator" or "Licensor") and the user ("Licensee") of the licensed material ("Material"), which includes Minecraft datapacks, mods, and resource packs. By using, installing, modifying, or otherwise interacting with the Material, the Licensee agrees to be bound by all the terms and conditions of this Agreement, unless specific exceptions are granted in writing by The Creator. This Agreement does not create an attorney-client relationship.

---------------------------------------------------------
1. Definitions
---------------------------------------------------------
1.1 "Material" means any Minecraft datapack, mod, or resource pack created and provided by The Creator.

1.2 "Licensee" means any individual or entity that uses, modifies, or attempts to distribute the Material.

1.3 "Private Server" means any Minecraft server operated for personal or community use that meets all of the following criteria:
    a. It does not generate any revenue through commercial activities, including but not limited to:
       - Selling in-game services, items, or perks;
       - Advertising, brand sponsorships, or hosting sponsorship deals;
       - Any other external source of income or financial benefit.
    b. It does not solicit or accept any monetary contributions or donations.
    c. It is limited to a closed circle of invited players (e.g., friends or a pre-approved, invite-only group) and is not advertised or made generally accessible to the public.
    d. The server must be maintained as a truly private, invitation-only environment. (No explicit numerical cap is imposed; however, the server must not be operated in a manner that effectively makes it open to the general public.)

1.4 "Commercial Use" means any use primarily intended for financial gain or involving revenue, including monetized content, fundraising, or revenue-generating modpacks. For clarity: Accepting any monetary contributions, donations, sponsorships, advertisements, or other forms of external income constitutes Commercial Use.

1.5 "Official Download Link" means the designated, legitimate URL(s) provided by The Creator that direct users to the Gamedash43 account on Modrinth, CurseForge, and/or Planet Minecraft.

1.6 "Private Use" means any use of the Material strictly for personal, non-commercial purposes without public distribution or commercial exploitation. This includes usage in singleplayer worlds, Private Servers, or any setting where the Material is not made available to the general public.

1.7 "Ephemeral Distribution" refers to the necessary, temporary transfer or copying of the Material’s files that occurs automatically during gameplay (e.g., when a server sends required data to connected clients) and does not result in permanent, user-accessible copies outside the server environment.

---------------------------------------------------------
2. License Grant
---------------------------------------------------------
2.1 Subject to the terms of this Agreement, The Creator grants the Licensee a non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide license to use the Material strictly for Private Use.

2.2 No rights are granted to publicly distribute, sublicense, or otherwise transfer the Material or any derivative thereof, except as expressly provided in Section 3.

---------------------------------------------------------
3. Permitted Use in Modpacks, Servers, and Content Creation
---------------------------------------------------------
3.1 Modpack Inclusion:
    a. The Material may be incorporated into a modpack under the following conditions:
         i. For unmodified modpacks: The Material may be included without written approval, provided that the modpack’s download page includes a clear and accessible Official Download Link directing users to the legitimate source.
         ii. For modified modpacks: If the Material is modified in any way for inclusion in the modpack, explicit written approval must be obtained from The Creator prior to inclusion.
         iii. The Licensee may add the .jar file directly into the modpack; however, distribution through CurseForge is preferred.
         iv. The inclusion of the Material in the modpack does not grant the Licensee any additional rights beyond those expressly set forth in this Agreement.
    b. The Licensee shall not use the Material outside of the approved modpack or as a standalone product, except as provided in Section 3.3.

3.2 Content Creation:
    a. The Licensee may create and publicly share original content (e.g., YouTube videos) featuring the Material, provided that the Material itself is not made available for download by third parties.
    b. Proper attribution, as specified in Section 4, must accompany any public content that features the Material.
    c. Monetized or ad-supported online videos are permitted without additional written approval, provided that all other terms of this Agreement are met.

3.3 Server Use and Ephemeral Distribution:
    a. Private Server Use: The Licensee may host or join Private Servers that use the Material, provided that:
         i. The server meets the criteria for a Private Server as defined in Section 1.3.
         ii. Players do not receive a permanent copy of the Material’s files outside the server environment.
         iii. The Licensee does not make the Material or its modified versions generally available for download.
         iv. The server operator is encouraged to recommend that players obtain the Material directly from the Official Download Link (Section 1.5) rather than distributing copies.
    b. Public Server Use (Commercial Server Use): With explicit written approval from The Creator, the Material may be used on public servers—even if they generate revenue. Such approved use is subject to any additional conditions provided by The Creator.
    c. Ephemeral Distribution is allowed solely to enable gameplay for authorized players within a server. This transfer does not constitute a broader right to distribute the Material.

3.4 Prohibition on Unauthorized Distribution:
    a. Except where explicitly allowed (e.g., Ephemeral Distribution on a Private Server, approved modpack usage, or approved Public Server Use), the Licensee is prohibited from distributing, sharing, or making available the Material—or any modified version thereof—to any third party.
    b. If any breach of these distribution restrictions is detected, The Creator will first attempt to resolve the issue by directly contacting the Licensee. If the issue is not resolved in a timely manner, The Creator reserves the right to file a DMCA takedown notice and pursue any other legal remedies available.

---------------------------------------------------------
4. Attribution
---------------------------------------------------------
4.1 Any public use of the Material must include clear and proper attribution to The Creator.

    a. A written credit that incorporates a hyperlink to the Official Download Link, prominently displayed in the description of any YouTube video or as a pinned comment.
    b. A verbal notice at the beginning of any YouTube video stating that a download link is available in the description or comment and that Gamedash43 is the creator of the Material.

4.3 Attribution is required solely for public content that features the Material and does not extend to Private Use.

5.2 No modified version or derivative work may be publicly distributed without explicit, prior written permission from The Creator.

5.3 Any modification intended for use in a public modpack or other public venue requires prior written approval from The Creator.

6.2 Versions of the Material distributed before April 5th, 2025, remain governed by their original license terms.

---------------------------------------------------------
9. General Provisions
---------------------------------------------------------
